IO Lab Project 3

Project title: LinkedIn Profiler

Project description: We are using the social classifications of the data on LinkedIn to create several visualizations to enhance the LinkedIn experience. Our LinkedIn Profiler displays your LinkedIn user's profile through several visualizations. One visualization shows a timeline of your past work positions. The map visualization shows the density of your connections based on their locations. The other visualization shows a bar chart of the number of your connections per industry. By clicking the industry, your connections will display to the right of the bar chart. If you click one of those connection icons, their work timeline will display on the page.
